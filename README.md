Can I automate my DCF process on excel using R?

  The top part of the code is where I load in the appropriate libraries. Then, I have a list of custom functions I am building that will hopefully automate the entire DCF process. As of right now, the functions are in most basic states. 

  The ultimate goal is to be able to use the custom functions with ease just by plugging in some key variables, such as stock ticker and date. I want to be able to run a detailed analysis of the companies financials and cash flows using the most minimal set of custom functions possible. In excel, the process can take a long time for just one stock. I hope to make it quicker in R if possible.
