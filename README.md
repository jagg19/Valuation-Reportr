Can I automate my DCF process on excel using R?

  The top part of the code is where I load in the appropriate libraries. Then, I have a list of custom functions I am building that will hopefully automate the entire DCF process. As of right now, the functions are in most basic states. The code below is my draft code, where I create and edit the code step by step before implementing into the custom fuctions.

  The ultimate goal is to be able to use the custom functions with ease just by plugging in some key variables, such as stock ticker and date. I want to be able to run a detailed analysis of the companies financials and cash flows using the most minimal set of custom functions possible. In excel, the process from fetching data, formatting, forecasting, inserting functions in cells, adding charts, then implementing each step by step process in a DCF analysis took between 4-6 hours for one stock. This is quite long, but I am very detailed and dive deep when analyzing the financials. I hope to be able to run this on 30 different stocks in the time it took me to do one.
